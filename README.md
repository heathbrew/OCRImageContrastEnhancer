- Image enhancement: The code utilizes OpenCV to enhance the quality of input images, making them more suitable for text extraction.
- Text extraction: PyTesseract, a powerful OCR engine, is integrated to extract text from images. The extracted text can be further processed for analysis or storage.
- Contrast manipulation: The scripts offer functionality to adjust the contrast of images, optimizing them for OCR and enhancing the accuracy of text extraction.
# Usage
Adjust the configuration settings in the code files to meet your requirements. This may include specifying the path to the Tesseract OCR executable or adjusting the contrast enhancement parameters.

Execute the code files to perform the desired tasks, such as image enhancement, text extraction, or contrast manipulation.
